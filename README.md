# Rust Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of Rust projects created as part of my journey learning the language.  
Most of the projects here are based on exercises and examples from the book **Programming Rust (O'Reilly)**, along with some additional mini-projects I build myself to explore concepts further.

---

## Purpose
- To practice and understand Rust fundamentals, idioms, and advanced features.
- To document my progress as I work through the book and beyond.
- To serve as a personal portfolio of Rust code written purely for **learning purposes**.

---

## Contents
Each subfolder in this repository represents a separate Rust project.  
Examples include:
- Book exercises (`actix-gcd`, `gcd_simple`, etc.)
- Self-made experiments and mini-projects
- Explorations of Rust libraries, crates, and tooling

---

## Important Note
No AI tools (LLMs, autocomplete assistants, or code generators) were used in the creation of these projects. **Copilot was used to write this well-formatted README**.
I am deliberately learning Rust **the old-school way** — a book and coding by myself.

---

## Disclaimer
- This repository is **not production code**.  
- It exists solely for educational purposes and personal growth.  
- Expect incomplete features, experimental ideas, and code written for practice rather than deployment.

---

## Portfolio Value
While not production-ready, this repo reflects:
- My dedication to learning Rust deeply.
- My ability to work through complex programming concepts without shortcuts.
- A growing body of work that demonstrates my progress in systems programming.

---

## Reference
- [Programming Rust, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) — the primary resource guiding these projects.
